# 🌸 **IRIS Flower Classification Project**

Welcome to the **IRIS Flower Classification** project!  
This repository contains everything needed to classify iris flowers into three species using machine learning models, with a public **Streamlit** web app.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
The **Iris Flower Dataset** contains three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — each identified by distinct measurements.  
We build machine learning models that learn from these measurements and **predict the flower species** automatically.

This project tackles a **multi-class classification** task by training, comparing, selecting, and deploying ML models.

---

## 📋 **Problem Statement**  
Manual classification of iris species is challenging due to overlapping features.  
This project creates an ML-based solution to **automate** and **simplify** the classification process, ensuring speed and accuracy.
